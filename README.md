# Upgradable Wands Mod
This mod's name was changed at day 2 of development from "Weird Materials Mod", but because i didn't like it nor was it descriptive of my plans. If you find any code referring to the mod as "wmm" or "Weird Materials Mod", please let me know.

**THIS MOD IS THE MOST WIP MOD EVER**

I plan on upgrades, so that you can craft an item and add it to the wand, for example RF storage or a crafting GUI.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/steinm07/Upgradable-Wands-Mod/wiki)
